# Contributing to CrUX-Lookup
Thanks for your interest in contributing to this little project! I'd definitely appreciate your input in any of the areas below:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Keep contributions on Github
I use github to host this project, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. At this point in time I don't have the capacity to maintain a presence elsewhere, so I will unfortunately have to ignore any material on other platforms.

## Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue a pull request and await a review from me. I maintain this codebase as free time permits, so please be mindful of that while waiting for reviews.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ilyamotamedi/crux-lookup/issues)
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ilyamotamedi/crux-lookup/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Please configure your linter to respect the .prettierrc config checked into this repo.
