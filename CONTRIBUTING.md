# Contributing to CrUX-Lookup
Thank you for your interest in contributing! Your contributions in any of the areas below would be appreciated:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Keep contributions on GitHub
I use GitHub to host this project, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. At this point in time I don't have the capacity to maintain a presence elsewhere, so I will unfortunately have to ignore any material on other platforms.

## Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue a pull request and await a review from me. I maintain this codebase as free time permits, so please be mindful of that while waiting for reviews.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/ilyamotamedi/crux-lookup/issues)
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ilyamotamedi/crux-lookup/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Please make sure to include:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Provide references to code if applicable
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Any notes or other insights (e.g. why you think this might be happening, solutions you tried that didn't work, etc.)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Please configure your linter to follow the .prettierrc config checked into this repo.
